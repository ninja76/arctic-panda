Ruby Astronomical Project (aka Arctic Panda)
================

Arctic Panda is an appliation designed to allow for the easy creation of vector based start maps that can be printed to almost any
paper size.

Added support for Amazon's SQS for the queuing of map build job requests.


Most of the algorithms and concepts have been ported from the excellent 
[PP3](http://pp3.sourceforge.net/) by Torsten Bronger
